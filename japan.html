    <h3>Tokyo, Japan</h3>
    <img src="images/japan.png" alt="Tokyo, Japan" title="Tokyo, Japan">
    <p>Japan is a known country where it feels like you're living in the future and I want to see and experience that myself which is why I want to go there. I also love watching anime and J-drama and I've seen a lot of places where there are tourist spots for those like the Attack on Titan. I also love Japanese food and I would love to see the cherry blossoms there.</p>
    <p>Tokyo’s mix of neon cityscapes and traditional shrines fascinates me. I picture taking the bullet train to Kyoto to wander through bamboo forests and historic temples, or visiting the quirky cafes of Harajuku. The efficient rail system makes intercity travel a breeze. I also want to experience the calm of a tea ceremony, attend a matsuri festival with lanterns and taiko drums, and try street foods like takoyaki and sushi fresh off the conveyor belt. The attention to detail everywhere—from clean streets to polite service—makes Japan seem like a dream destination.</p>
