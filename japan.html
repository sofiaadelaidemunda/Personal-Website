    <p>Japan is a known country where it feels like you're living in the future and I want to see and experience that myself which is why I want to go there. I also love watching anime and J-drama and I've seen a lot of places where there are tourist spots for those like the Attack on Titan. I also love Japanese food and I would love to see the cherry blossoms there.</p>

    <p>Japan's mix of neon cityscapes and traditional shrines fascinates me. I picture taking the bullet train to Kyoto to wander through bamboo forests and historic temples, or visiting the quirky cafes of Harajuku. The efficient rail system makes intercity travel a breeze. I also want to experience the calm of a tea ceremony, attend a matsuri festival with lanterns and taiko drums, and try street foods like takoyaki and sushi. The attention to detail everywhere—from clean streets to polite service—makes Japan seem like a dream destination for me.</p>
