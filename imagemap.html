<section id="southkorea" class="place-card">
  <h3>Seoul, South Korea</h3>
  <img src="images/southkorea.png" alt="Seoul, South Korea" title="Seoul, South Korea">
  <p>As an avid K-drama and K-pop fan, visiting South Korea is definitely a dream come true for me. I've been a fan of K-pop and K-drama ever since I was in elementary. As I fangirl over them, I get to see glimpse of what South Korea looks like and it even made me want to visit it soon. I want to experience eating Korean street food, go to the iconic places K-drama's were filmed at, and attend a concert of my favorite K-pop groups.</p>

<section id="switzerland" class="place-card">
  <h3>Switzerland</h3>
  <img src="images/switzerland.png" alt="Switzerland" title="Switzerland">
  <p>Switzerland became one of my dream places to visit because of how beautiful the country is through photos I saw. I feel like it is so peaceful to live there, it just screams that kind of vibe. I also love how the place looks like it's a twist of modern and at the same time old-fashioned style. </p>

<section id="Tokyo, Japan" class="place-card">
  <h3>Tokyo, Japan</h3>
  <img src="images/japan.png" alt="Tokyo, Japan" title="Tokyo, Japan">
  <p>Japan is a known country where it feels like you're living in the future and I want to see and experience that myself which is why I want to go there. I also love watching anime and J-drama and I've seen a lot of places where there are tourist spots for those like the Attack on Titan. I also love Japanese food and I would love to see the cherry blossoms there. </p>

<section id="Paris, France" class="place-card">
  <h3>Paris, France</h3>
  <img src="images/paris.png" alt="Paris, France" title="Paris, France">
  <p>"Paris is the city of love" as they say. This is one of my dream destinations specifically for its Eiffel Tower. I would love to view the city lights at night and admire the infrastructures built that are like ancient. </p>

<section id="Rome, Italy" class="place-card">
  <h3>Rome, Italy</h3>
  <img src="images/rome.png" alt="Rome, Italy" title="Rome, Italy">
  <p>Rome is a city where it is very rich in culture, art, and history. I am always amazed on their historical and architectural wonders whenever I would see images of it. Another reason I want to visit here is because this is my mom's dream place to visit, which is why I want to go with her here someday. </p>
