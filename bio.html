        <b>I was born and raised in a small town in Pasig City, surrounded by the love of a simple but happy family.</b> I grew up being a lolo and lola’s girl, and that bond with my grandparents is my sense of comfort that shaped my childhood. I spent my childhood at home, while some people might find it very plain or even boring, for me, <b>those were the happiest and memorable moments I treasure in my life.</b> I have 2 siblings, a girl and a boy, and playing with them filled my days with happiness, which is why I don’t find it boring to stay at home. After school, my routine was simple: I would usually rest, do my assignments, and later on play with my siblings until bedtime. Sundays, holidays or special occasions were always special to me because this is where the whole family gets to be complete and we’ll bond the whole day. Every Sunday, my parents would take us to a park in the morning to run and play. After that, in the afternoon, we’ll go travel to different places like Luneta Park, Ocean Park, and other fun places. <b>We would fly a kite, have a picnic, and explore new places, just enjoying the moment as a family.</b> Moments like this make me feel grateful for my parents’ hard work for us because I know that they’re doing it to provide our needs and wants, yet they still made time to be present and bond with us. During my childhood, this is where I also discovered <b>my love for reading books,</b> which made me more knowledgeable and opened my imagination to new worlds. <b>I also found joy in dancing and performing on stage.</b> For me, it’s not just a hobby, but something that I love and am passionate about doing. I’m thankful my parents were very supportive of the things that I love to do. They would always be there in every performance I have, cheering me on, and their support gave me the confidence to continue doing what I loved. <b>I can say that my childhood was filled with warmth and simplicity.</b> I grew up learning valuable lessons that shaped what I value in life. Looking back, my childhood was not just about the material things, but <b>about family, warmth, togetherness, and discovering myself.</b> It taught me kindness, respect, the value of hard work, and being authentic, carrying myself with strength and grace. <b>These values became the foundation of the person I am today.</b></p>

        <b>My teenage years were a journey of change and self-discovery.</b> I entered junior high school in a completely different environment. Despite being anxious about stepping out of my comfort zone, I’m grateful I did. I faced challenges balancing my academics and personal life. Although it was challenging, I’m thankful I was surrounded by supportive friends and classmates who make my school life better. <b>I joined various competitions until senior high school, such as quiz bees, impromptu speeches, debates, and essay writing contests.</b> These opportunities helped me grow not only as a student but also as a person. It helped build my confidence, and taught me that <b>with faith, determination, hard work, and passion, I can achieve goals I set for myself.</b> I also attended various seminars, which further broadened my knowledge about myself, others, and the community. Despite having lots of responsibilities at school, I made sure to balance them with personal time. I still get to bond with my family and friends on the weekends or whenever I’m not busy with school anymore. Those moments were my kind of breather whenever I’m feeling overwhelmed and stressed at school. <b>Then came the pandemic, which has limited actions outside.</b> It was a struggle to adjust to life at home and online classes. Completely staying at home made me realize and think about a lot of things, and one of those is my dreams and future career. This is where my interest in computers and programming came from, which guided me in choosing a program for college. <b>My teenage years taught me independence and resilience.</b> I went through life’s highs and lows, but I’m glad I did because those <b>taught me how to stand up on my own and carry myself forward.</b> Each moment gave me knowledge, growth, and valuable lessons to take with me as I climb another step. Looking back, everything I went through <b>shaped me as a person equipped with more wisdom and strong faith.</b> </p>

        <strong>“The future belongs to those who believe in the beauty of their dreams.” – Eleanor Roosevelt.</strong> I can clearly remember how this quote popped up on my social media just when I was preparing for my college journey. Hearing a lot of good and bad things about college gave me mixed emotions about how I would experience it. I thought of, <b>“Will I also experience the same struggles they had?” “Is it really that difficult?”</b> Those thoughts repeatedly came to my mind, and upon reading that quote, it somehow gave me comfort and reminded me of why I endured to reach this far — <b>for my dreams and for my family.</b> Just upon choosing a program, I’m already anxious about whether I can make it through and if this is really the path for me. After a lot of reflection and searching, <b>I chose Computer Science as my program for college at the University of the East.</b> As my first day of school came, excitement and nervousness were the emotions that I felt. I was looking forward to meeting new people in a new environment and learn a lot about programming. My freshman year in college was a roller coaster ride. As I was still adjusting to everything about the environment, it was a challenge for me to find my rhythm in balancing my academic and personal life. As days go by, little by little, I started to get the hang of it, and <b>I’m grateful for my friends who made my college days bearable.</b> Later on, I was able to balance my academic and social life. I also learned three different programming languages so far, and I can say that it was challenging for me. <b>Creating a program requires patience and skills,</b> which made me admire the programmers behind every program I see. Despite the challenges I faced academically, my professors were there to guide and help along the way, which made learning bearable. I’m now in my sophomore year, and I can say that each level brings level up challenges. Honestly, there are times when I’m being bothered by doubt in myself and in my abilities, but <b>I always try to remember the reason why I’m holding on this far.</b> Through different people, perspectives, and experiences, I started to learn more and <b>view the world from a wider perspective.</b> I grew emotionally and intellectually. I know it is still a long journey ahead, but I’m looking forward to where life will take me. <strong>Ika nga nila, “Malayo pa, pero malayo na.”</strong></p>
