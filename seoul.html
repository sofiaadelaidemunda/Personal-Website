    <h3>Seoul, South Korea</h3>
    <img src="images/southkorea.png" alt="Seoul, South Korea" title="Seoul, South Korea">
    <p>As an avid K-drama and K-pop fan, visiting South Korea is definitely a dream come true for me. I've been a fan of K-pop and K-drama ever since I was in elementary. As I fangirl over them, I get to see glimpse of what South Korea looks like and it even made me want to visit it soon. I want to experience eating Korean street food, go to the iconic places K-drama's were filmed at, and attend a concert of my favorite K-pop groups.</p>
    <p>Beyond the pop culture, I'm drawn to Seoul's blend of ancient and modern. I imagine walking through Gyeongbokgung Palace in traditional hanbok, strolling along the Han River at night, and wandering the crowded alleys of Myeongdong for shopping and food. The city’s efficient subway makes exploring easy, and I’d love to ride the cable car up Namsan Mountain to see the N Seoul Tower lit up. Korean festivals like Cherry Blossom season and Chuseok also look so vibrant—I’d love to time a visit to experience those holidays firsthand.</p>
