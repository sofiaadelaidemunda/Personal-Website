    <h3>Rome, Italy</h3>
    <img src="images/rome.png" alt="Rome, Italy" title="Rome, Italy">
    <p>Rome is a city where it is very rich in culture, art, and history. I am always amazed on their historical and architectural wonders whenever I would see images of it. Another reason I want to visit here is because this is my mom's dream place to visit, which is why I want to go with her here someday.</p>    <p>Imagining myself throwing a coin into the Trevi Fountain, walking through the Roman Forum, and standing inside the Colosseum gives me chills. I also want to explore the Vatican, marvel at Michelangelo’s Sistine Chapel ceiling, and taste authentic pasta carbonara in a family-run trattoria. The lively street markets, gelato on every corner, and Vespa scooters zipping by paint a picture of a vibrant, living history. Sharing this trip with my mom would make it even more special—experiencing her dream and creating memories together.</p>  </section>
