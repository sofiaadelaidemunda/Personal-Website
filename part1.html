    <h2>Shaped by Innovation</h2>
<p>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <b>Our technology nowadays is innovating to expand its use even more.</b> As technology advances, we also keep up with it and its trends. If I'm going to ask you, <b>how are you using technology? Do you use it for something good?</b> We all have different ways and reasons on why we use it.</p></div>

<h2>The Language of Screens</h2>
<div align="justify">
<p> 
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <b>We use technology almost everday in our lives.</b> It's one part of our life or daily living now. There are various reasons why we use it and one of the reasons is to <b>connect with other people.</b> There are a lot of social media platforms we can use to communicate with others and also express ourselves online. Another reason is we use it to <b>learn or gather more information about anything.</b> Just type or ask what you're looking for and in just one click, various answers are already given. Personally, as a student and an individual, <b>I find technology almost a part of me</b> because of how frequent I use it. Every day, I use it to connect/communicate with family and friends online, learn my lessons and search homework-related questions for school, and  I also use it for entertainment. Given on how frequent we use it, <b>we must also know the right way how.</b> We should be mindful of the things that we share and read online. <b>We should use technology to create a safe space for everyone online.</b></p></div>

<h2>Carrying Tech Forward</h2>
<div align="justify">
<p> 
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <b>We can't deny that technology is already a part of us.</b> From the various reasons why we use it, to how often we do, it became a part of our daily life. Upon using it, <b>we should always be mindful and respectful</b> because no matter how useful it is, it may be a start of conflicts and misunderstandings. <b>Together, let's use technology as a safe spacefor you, me, and all the human race.</b></p></div>
